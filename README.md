# Stocks-Analysis
Extracting essential data from a dataset and displaying it is a necessary part of data science; therefore individuals can make correct decisions based on the data. In this project, I have extracted some stock data, and then displayed it in a graph
To view the graphs 
  1. Open the jupyter notebook from the repository.
  2. Download the code from the Download button at top right.
  3. Wait for the JSON text to load.
  4. Press ctrl+S and manually retypr the extension .ipynb at the end of the name, and change the file type to All Files
  5. Open the file using the installed software in your PC(VS Code, Anaconda Jupyter Notebook, etc).
  6. The graphs should be visible now.
